- GSK definition

  - GSK parameter d2scribes the percent of generation shifted from transmission system(s) to distribution system


- 53 bus test

  - in transmission region, slack bus cannot be selected as connection point
  - multiple connections between regions are possible
  - connection between 2 distribution is possible
  - max gsk of both case (53-I and 53-II) can reach 1
    - all generation in distributions are shifted to transmission
    - there is no significant different result between 2 test cases (computing time, iteration)
